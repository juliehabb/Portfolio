                        <h6>The Problem</h6>
                        <p>The goal was to make a product to help new parents, mothers in particular, to have a better time after giving birth in the hospital as mental health issues and stress is high in this demographic. </p>

                <h2>The process</h2>
                <p>We used design thinking to guide us through this process.</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
                <p>In order to get a better idea of the problem, we used the following research approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Literature review</li>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Affinity mapping</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Research Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Many parents are very unsure about everything during the first weeks of having a baby. At  the same time, many women feel like they are not getting adequate help/care after birth in the maternity ward.</li>
                    <li>
                        Many people do not want to burden the hospital staff, so they do not ask for help, especially when the nurses seem busy or are not receptive to their questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many parents become increasingly uncertain because of all the different information they read and hear about online. Therefore some feel like it is important to learn the basics and not delve too deep to not get stressed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many parents are focused mainly on the day of the birth. They are often not prepared for what comes after. This situation could create a negative impact on their experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The parents feel anxious and worried because of the lack of information from the hospital or not getting adequate time to answer their questions or even ask the right questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Women need to get an adequate debriefing about the birth as part of the recovering process that helps with mental and physical challenges they went or might go through.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Persona</h2>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <h2>Context Scenario</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1</p>
                        <p>This is the first day of Sarah as a new mother. She spends the night constantly thinking about her new-born baby and how to breastfeed since the nurses didn't explain how to do it correctly.     </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2</p>
                        <p>Sarah also had a difficult birth and struggling to relax. She is exhausted after the birth and overwhelmed by what she went through. Now, the baby in her arms and thinking, "What should I do now?". While she was pregnant, all she could think about was up to the point of birth, not what comes after.           </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3</p>
                        <p>Now she is waiting and expecting that the nurses will come and give her feedback. Since the birth, the nurses seem very busy. Sarah is hesitant to ask them about the things she is unsure about. Eventually, she decided to get some answers, and when she finally asked the nurse, the reply came rushed and unclear. She felt unwelcomed to ask more questions.      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>4</p>
                        <p>Sarah is stressed and unsure about what she is doing. She feels she is left on her own without any support, not as she anticipated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>5</p>
                        <p>She is worried that she isn't able to get all the answers before going home. Questions constantly pop up, and she doesn't know what to ask. She is worried that if she doesn't get enough information, something could go wrong, like in the articles she has read online.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>6</p>
                        <p>She is unsecured about going home with new-born baby, also afraid that she wouldn't be able to do things right, and unable to respond fast if the baby is sick or needs help.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <div class="insight">
                    <p>New mothers are feeling extremely overwhelmed after giving birth because they are struggling to access the necessary information from nursing staff when needed. If we can solve this problem, they would feel more safe and confident and reduce their mental stress.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>How Might We</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>How might we help Sarah being confident in asking the right questions?</li>
                    <li>How might we give her a reassurance that everything is good? </li>
                    <li>How might we make her relax after giving birth?</li>
                    <li>How might we help her process her emotions after the birth?</li>
                    <li>How might we reduce cognitive load for new parents?</li>
                    <li>How might we prepare parents better for the time after the birth?</li>
                    <h2>Ideation Process</h2>
                    <p>We took the time to reflect on our persona, user scenarios and problem statement. Then used HMW questions to fuel our ideation sessions to generate ideas that could solve the users pain points. Here are the methods we used:</p>
