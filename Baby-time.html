                            Many parents are very unsure about everything during the first weeks of having a baby. At  the same time, many women feel like they are not getting adequate help/care after birth in the maternity ward.</li>
                        <li class="custom-bullets">
                            Many people do not want to burden the hospital staff, so they do not ask for help, especially when the nurses seem busy or are not receptive to their questions.
                        </li>
                        <li class="custom-bullets padding-bottom">
                            Many parents become increasingly uncertain because of all the different information they read and hear about online. Therefore some feel like it is important to learn the basics and not delve too deep to not get stressed.
                        </li>
                        <li class="custom-bullets padding-bottom">
                            Many parents are focused mainly on the day of the birth. They are often not prepared for what comes after. This situation could create a negative impact on their experience.
                        </li>
                        <li class="custom-bullets padding-bottom">
                            The parents feel anxious and worried because of the lack of information from the hospital or not getting adequate time to answer their questions or even ask the right questions.

                        <li class="li-numb">Sarah also had a difficult birth and struggling to relax. She is exhausted after the birth and overwhelmed by what she went through. Now, the baby in her arms and thinking, "What should I do now?". While she was pregnant, all she could think about was up to the point of birth, not what comes after.

                            Now she is waiting and expecting that the nurses will come and give her feedback. Since the birth, the nurses seem very busy. Sarah is hesitant to ask them about the things she is unsure about. Eventually, she decided to get some answers, and when she finally asked the nurse, the reply came rushed and unclear. She felt unwelcomed to ask more questions.

                            She is worried that she isn't able to get all the answers before going home. Questions constantly pop up, and she doesn't know what to ask. She is worried that if she doesn't get enough information, something could go wrong, like in the articles she has read online.
